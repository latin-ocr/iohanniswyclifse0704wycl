Mr. Austin has gone to Cambridge to copy the unique MS.
01 De Actibus Animae at Corpus, and Mr. Dziewicki will
edit it. Before September, Mr. Austin hopes to finish copy-
ing the second part 01 De Ente, or at least that portion of it
—Tracts 4 and 5—which exists in MS. at Vienna. By the
end 01 this year, 1890, nearly all of the Society's unfinisht
work should be copied, and in Editors' hands. If this result
is attaind, Members will—the Committee feel sure—condone
the past delays in the delivery of their volumes to them.

6. During 1891, at least four 01 the books named above
ought to be ready, besides those assignd to 1889 and 1890.
If they are, the Committee will not put off the issue of them,
but will send out two for 1891 and two for 1892, asking
Members 101· Adcance Subscripte’ons for one of these years. It
will be a proud day for the Wyolif Society, which has been
for nine years in annual arrear with its work, if it can,
for a happy change, be a year in advance. Those Members
who care enough for Wyclif to pay their advance subscrip-
tion will get their books in advance; those who don't, will
get their volumes (11 they pay promptly) in the first week
of January in the year the books are assignd to, instead 01
waiting for them, as heretofore, till the March or June 01
the year following. They will thus benefit by the generosity
of the Advance-Subscribers. If only the Society could, on
this plan, get its remaining eight years' work done in four,
the gain to all concernd would be great.

7. Mr. F. D. Matthew has again been obliged to give all the
time that he can spare the Society, to writing the side-notes
to Prof. Loserth's, Dr. Beer's, and Dr. Herzberg-Frankel's
volumes, reading Dr. Poole's, and Mr. Dziewicki's, and
making suggestions with regard to them, so that his own
editions 01 Wyclif ’s De Mamlafe's and De Statu Innocentme
must be deferd till he has more leisure.

8. Dr. Buddensieg has done about a third of his edition
01 the De Veritate, but having accepted a call to the Head
Mastership of a Public High School in Dresden, his new duties
will not allow him to take up his Wyclif work for at least two
or three years. Prof. Loserth has kindly undertaken to edit
Wyclif's Opus Emmqelesscmn, sice De Sermone Domini in Monte
(Shirley, No. 42). M. Patera is proceeding slowly with his
edition 01 De Pate-state.

During 1889, Dr. Annenberg, the Librarian of the Stock-
holm Royal Library, was so good as to send to the British
Museum, for the Society's use, John Huss's copy of six 01
Wyclif's neatises, with a Replicatio cle Unde-malibus by some
