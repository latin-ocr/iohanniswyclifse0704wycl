IV INTRODUCTION.

frailty should be secretly shown to the priest (voluit Deus quod
occulte ostendatur infirmitas sacerdoti p. 301). Yet other sermons
contain passages in which he speaks with evident contempt of
auriculas confession, calling it (as in the third volume) a human
invention and a notorious fraud, taking its rise from Innocent III.1
There are, he says, two kinds of confession, one before God‚ the
other before men, and the latter is an invention of rnen. Only
confession to God is necessary to salvation. And in another sermon
(pp. 55—57) he exposes the abuses connected with auriculas con·
fession2 which ought on their account to be abolished. Here we have
clearly a direct contradiction.

ln Sermon XXXIII Wyclif speaks (p. 289) of the merit of fasting
(de bono ieiunio); in another sermon he makes light of fasting. The
greed of the priests, he says (p. 55) orders fasting,3 Christ and the
apostles did not set much store by it.4

Equally contradictory is his teaching about purgatory.

Whilst he says in the LVlh sermon that the greatest work of
charity that can be shown to a dead man is to shorten his suffering
in purgatory (p. 433); whilst in the same sermon he speaks of those
who are burnt in Hell according to the sins which they have
committed (p. 432), in the second sermon he makes light of prayers
for the dead, and sets forth a doctrine which was accepted and
perfected by the TaboriteS, who, as is well known, rejected purgatory.5

Finally, Wyclif's utterances about merit before God are also in
contradiction to his language about the Praesciti -— i. e. the reprobate,

¹ [deo absit Deum iustum et racionabilem qui non potest nisi graciose et
leviter hominem onerare, requirere simpliciter ad delecionem peccati vel assistenciam
sacerdotis terreni vel vocalem formacioncm loquele. Et ista consessio ad Deum
intelligitur communiter in scriptura. 2 Est duplex confessio scilicet confessio
singulariter facta Deo et confessio ex institutione innocencii ΙΙΙ facta proprio sacerdoti.
Prima est dignior, sundabilior et necessarior quam secunda, quia de prima confessione
loquitur scriptura generaliter et nusquam de secunda. Ideo videtur multis quod
ecclesia melius militaret sine illa. '³ Et sic licet in confessionibus ieiunium ac
elerii‹›s)-11a communiter sunt iniuncta, tamen consessorum avaricia cst sepe in causa,
quare iste partes penitencie ex intencione infecta communiter maculantur. 4 Et ideo
Christus et sui apostoli tale opus misericordie nichil ant modicum attendebant.
