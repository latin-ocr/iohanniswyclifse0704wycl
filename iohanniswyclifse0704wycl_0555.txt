Reasonable folk will see at once that with this great outlay on
copying—an outlay without which the Society could not have
moved a step—large issues of books have been impossible.
Moreover, Members must remember that over AE150 worth
of work done for them has been paid, not by them, but by the
Bishops’ Fund (AEIOOL and by the other donations to the Society
which have amounted to AEssQ 143. The Committee cannot make
bricks without straw. The Society's issues depend solely on
the amount its Members subscribe3 and if any Member com-
plains of the smallness of the issues, he should feel bound in
conscience to accompany his complaint with a 5850 note in

early Reformer's memory, the printing of all the Latin
works he has left, in which the record and development of
his ideas are to be traced. Many years of strenuous effort
are needed for this task, both on the part of Members in
general and the Society's Editors in particular. Much copying
of MSS. has still to be done. New Editors for some of
the Treatises already copied, and for those still untoucht‚ are
wanted. The preparation of a Wyclif MS. sor press is no
easy matter, as Dr. Poole explaind 111 the Report for 18843
it 011611 takes years of the scanty leisure which an Editor
can spare from the other engrossing work of his life. Mean-
time the duty of subscr-ibing Members is clear: to provide
the money wanted for copying and printing3 10 pay their
own Subscriptions promptly, and to canvas all their friends
and acquaintances 101· 111016.
