ΧΠ INTRODUCTION.

The last sermon (Dominus vobiscum) is also contained in two
MSS. of the Vienna Imperial Library, 3929 Ξ Κ, and 1337 z L.
For the collation of these Ι have to thank Director Buddensieg of
Dresden, and Professor V. von Renner of Vienna.

Ι may take this opportunity to mention that Ι have just learned
through the kindness of Professor Goll, that in the archives of the
Moravian brotherhood at Hersenhut there is a MS. containing some
of Wyclif's sermons viz:

x. [Caput-gato vetus fermentum (fol. 'Ji-*Lxffl = Wyclif Sermones, ed. Loserth,
ΙΙΙ, 101 et seqq.

2, Omne qnod natum est Deo (hol. 41'¹—4.⁷''l = Serni. Ill, ¹9¹) et seqq.

4. Obsecro vos tamqnam advenas thol. 53³—5svbl Ξ Sei-m. Ill, 213-215, 1. 12
(cetera desunt).

5. Explicacio capitis Apocalypsis lx* (fol. [μβ-147) Ξ Serm. ΙΙΙ, 2Γι7 seqq.
ln this MS. l, 61 there is also:

ΠΙ. The Date of composition and editmq.

The date of composition of this fourth part of the Sermons
has been fully dealt with in the introduction to the first volume, and
Ι have nothing to add to what is said there. This applies also to
the editing. Ι have only to express my hearty thanks to all those
gentlemen who have actively helped me in editing this volume; to
the Founder of our Society for his ever lively interest in the progress
of the work, to Mr. F. D. Matthew — who not only wrote the
English side-notes, but aided the editor in writing the critical and
material commentary by most valuable hints — finally to Director
Dr Rudolf Buddensieg who his given his kind ¹attention to this as to
the previous volumes.
