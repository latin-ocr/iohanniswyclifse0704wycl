all property in 11101111111111.1 All the evil in the Church springs from
Constantine, and his rich endowment of her. This Caesarism of the
Church must cease.2 Not less strongly does he inveigh against the
ubuses practised as to indulgences,3 but specially against the Popedom
of his time and its supportS, the begging friars. It is an usurpation
of the Popes to claim to be the head of the (Ξ1111Γεῑ11.4 The Papal
office is a poisonous one.5

The Pope is liable to error‚⁶ and a marginal note adds that
it would be a meritorious work⁷ to overthrow the Papacy.8 Most
of all does Wyclif denounce the papal crusade3 the apostle Peter, he
remarks ironically, when he was in the dungeon did not summor] the
Church to set him free.

Then too the method of the Popes' election,‘³ their worldliness‚
their greed of earthly wealth‚ are an abomination to him.

Still fiercer are the attacks on the Mendicants3 it is they who
bring the whole Church into confusion, ¹0 who burden and weaken
it.¹¹ They are sons of Satan who, instead of living by the work of
their hands, plunder the realm.12 Worse than Herod, Judas Iscariot
and Saul, ¹3 they urge secular rulers to injustice, they extort undue
contributions from their penitents‚ they sin against the commands
of Christian charity, and in the matter of the crusade they are really
heretics. 14 Their sects should be abolished as damnable, and their
letters of indulgence are in truth blasphemons.¹5

It is evident from these quotations how much the contents of
the Sermones Mixti differ from those of the Quadraginta Sermones.
