Yet even in the latter there are scattered passages which are quite
like the Sermones Mixti; as for example when (in XXV) Wyclif calls
the Pope Antichrist¹ or welches, in the same sermon, that brotherly
correction belongs not to the clergy but to the lay power. In like
manner he introduces the wellknown comparison of the members
of claustral orders to a corpse risen from the sepulchre, wrapped in
graveclothes, and driven by the devil among rnen —- a comparison
borrowed by Wyclif from Robert Grosseteste. In Sermon LVI (p. 437)
a reference will be found to simple priests.'' —=—

All these passages seem to have been inserted at the last
revision of the text.

. Besides these two main parts —- the Viginti and 'Quadraginta
Sermones — composing the fourth volume ofthis collection ofsermons,
four other sermons deserve to be mentioned, belonging to neither of
those groups: they are the two first and the two last sermons.
They were certainly composed during the last years of Wyclif's life,
for in them he repeats with the utmost severity his condemnation
of the system prevalent in the church. The devii, so he teaches in
his last sermon, has contrived to introduce the sins of the clergy
into the church. Through pride he has brought in patronage and has
made the Church rich, so as to pave the way to simony.

And in this hierarchy are four degrees, since there are four
orders introduced without Christ's leave3 the cesarean clergy, endowed
monks‚ canons and friars. And as these four sects have not entered
the church through Christ the Lord, they bring it into confusion and
they are robbers. Thus the devil has waxed strong against the Church
in malice and in snares. Every Christian then should strive to
restore the Church to the state that Christ ordered.

To this end there are three means. Ι. The prelates should live
in poverty as the apostle bids‚ and then they would not be
simoniacs thirsting after benefices. ΙΙ. If they do not fulfil their
pastoral duties‚ the faithful should withdraw tithes and offeringS.
ΙΙΙ. The people should support the wise and faithful priest who
guides his flock according to God's law.
