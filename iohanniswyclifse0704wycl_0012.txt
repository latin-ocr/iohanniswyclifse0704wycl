vlu INTRODUCTION.

Π, The Manusoripts.

As the present collection is composed of two main groups of
sermon5‚ the Sermones mixti and the Quadraginta Sermones (dum
stetit in scolis), we must distinguish several groups of MSS. First, those
containing all the sermons, secondly, MSS. in which only the Sermones
Mixti are to be found3 thirdly, others having the Quadraginta Sermones;
l'‹)urthly and finally, those containing only single sermons. To the
first group belongs the Codex B, 16, 2 of Trinity College, Cam-
bridge (A), described in the first volume of the Sermones (pp. XXXV
to XXXVII); to the second group belong the two MSS. of the Vienna
Imperial Library NO 3928 (D) and NO 3931 (Ε) also mentioned in the
first volume (pp. XXXVIII—XXXIX).

The Sermones Quadraginta are in the Codd. pal. Vindob. 3928
and 3932 (G), and in the Cod. Lambeth 23 (H). The Cod. pal.
Vind. 3932 (G), has been already sufficiently described by Lechler in
his edition of the Trialogus (pp. 24—26). The Codex 3928 contains
both the Sermones Mixti and the Quadraginta Sermones, yet it cannot
be reckoned in our first group, since both divisions are not written
by the same hand, nor do they follow immediately one upon another.

To the last group finally belong the Codex of Trinity CoHege,
Dublin, C, I 23 (F) (see De Ecclesia, pp. XXII and XXIII, and
Sermones msa volume, p. 4), the Cod. IIl G 11 (I) of the Prague
University Library, the Codd. 3929 (K) and 1337 (L) of the Vienna
Imperial Library (cf. VVycl. Pol. Works ed. ssuddensieg, pag. XXIX and
pag. XL). As all these MSS. except H and I have been described at
large, some remarks on these two Codices may suffice.

H is a volume belonging to the library of the Archbishop of
Canterbury at Lambeth, NO 23. It is on vellum 15¹]2 inches high,
11 inches broad, and rather more than 2 inches thick. Each page
has two columns 11¹,s‘2 >< ‘3274 inches, containing about 68 lines. It
is well and clearly written in a hand of about 1400. There is an
illuminated letter and flourish at the beginning of each treatise‚ and
the initial letter of each sermon is slightly adorned. Alternate red
and blue paragraph marks are distributed somewhat capriciously. The
leather binding is stamped with the arms of archbishop Bancroft
(1604—1610), and no doubt belongs to his time. It retains its clasps.
