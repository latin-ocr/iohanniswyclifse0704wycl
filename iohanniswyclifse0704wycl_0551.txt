1. The last Report (March 1889) acknowledgd that

the Wyclif Society had been in arrear with the issue 01 its
work for every one of the eight years of its existence, but
showd cause for hoping that 1889 would see not only its own
books sent out, but possibly also those 01 1890. Sad experi-
ence, however, has resulted in not even one of the 1889 books
being issued in its year, or the arrear volume of 1888. Τ110
forbearance 01 Members must still be askt, and the appeal
again made to them to be sure that the Society’s Editors and
Copiers have done all they can, 03011 to forward his own
work, tho’ the pressure 01 other engagements has prevented
his producing it in the wisht-for time: a man's vocation
ought to and must be set before his avocation; and all the
Society's workers are men engaged in the business of life,
who have but spare hours to give to the Society's service and
their duty to lecmF.

But though 1889 saw none of its own books sent out, it did
see issued the arrear-book for 1887, De Qfficz'o Reqis, edited
by A. W. Pollard, MA„ and O. Sayle, B.A.‚ and did get the
arrear-book for 1888, De Apostasm, edited by Mr. M. H.
Dziewicki, into the binders' hands, so that it appeard 111
January, 1890. Last year also saw Prof. Loserth's fourth
and final volume of Wyclif's Sermone all in type: but the
englishing of its Introduction and other causes have delayd
its sending-out till now, May 1890.

2. Τ110 Society's issue for 1889 will therefore be: 1.Vol.
IV. of Wyclif’s Sermons, edited by Prof. Loserth, Ph.D.,
