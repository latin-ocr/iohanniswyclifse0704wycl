condemned from all eternity —- a contradiction to which a scribe of
the [5¹¹¹ century called attention.

To what must we attribute all these contradictions} The present
collection is not, like each of the first three parts, a piece of one
castIng, but consists of two distinct partS, which differ very much in
their subject and extent.

The larger of these two collections of sermons was composed
before Wyclif broke into open antagonism to the ruling Church, “dum
stetit in scolis”‚ consequently before he had attained the degree of D. D.

These sermons, 40 in number (Sermones Quadraginta), begin
with Ν0 XXIII, and are written essentially in the spirit os the
prevailing hierarchy. So much is this the case that a scribe of the
15¹¹¹ century could not suppress the remark that “the Wyclif os these
sermons was quite another man than was to be found in the remaining
works3 for, except in a few passageS‚ his teaching perfectly corresponds
with that of the Church.⁷'¹

In these few words the general character of these 40 Sermons
is correctly described. What is said of the exceptions also hits the
mark, and we have only to enquire to what period these exceptions
belong.

Before we can solve this question, we must examine more
closely the other sermons of the fourth part, which form the section
of the XXIV Sermones Mixti, and are called in the MSS. Sermones XX
in fine vitae suae.

They belong then, as a whole, to the last years of Wyclif’s life,
and bear an altogether different stamp from the Sermones quadraginta.

Here the war against the prevailing abuses of the Church takes
the first place. Wyclif demands that the Church should be restored
to its “apostolic’' state, according to which the clergy are bound to
live in poverty like Christ and his apostles.

The tithes they receive are mere alms⁷ and ought to be with-
drawn from wicked priests.2 The King has the right to confiscate
