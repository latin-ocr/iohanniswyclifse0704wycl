2 Tlce Society's Book-s for 1889, 1890, ancl 1891.

and such smaller one of the following works—of each of
which the whole is in type—as shall first leave the press :—

De Dominio Divino, edited by Dr. Reginald Lane Poole,
lately re-collated by him in the Vienna University
Library, with a long Appendix of the first four Books
of the De Pauper-ie Sala-aforis of Richard F itz-Ralph,
Archbishop of Armagh, to whose doctrine of Dominion,
Wyclif owed much. This work is printing at the Claren-
don Press, Oxford, and almost all of it is in type.

De Ente predicamentum and Quaestione& Loyz‘cae, edited by
Dr. Rudolf Beer from the MSS. at Vienna and Prague,
printing at Fromme's, Vienna.

De δίηῑοηῖα, edited by Dr. Herzberg-FrankeL printing at
F romme's, Vienna.

3. The second and third of the three last—named works,
if both leave the press during the present year, will probably
form the Society's issue for 1890. But if one of them is delayd
beyond the date when Mr. Dziewicki's edition of De Bla-spleemia,
or of Loyz'ca and Loffl'cae continuatio, or De Materia et Forma
and other short treatises is ready, this will be substituted for
the delayd volume.

4. For 1891, Prof. Loserth's edition of De Eucharistia
will be ready early in the year, as nearly 200 pages of it are
now in type. The other volume for 1891 will be such of the
then unissued works named in sections 2 and 3 as is first
read .

5.y One great hindrance to the progress of work in 1889
was the lack of copiers in Vienna. Had Lofflme Conflata-etio
been copied in time, Mr. Dziewicki would have sent it to
press last year, and De Blasplzemia too, had its collation been
completed3 but the time that our Vienna copiers could give
to our work did not enable them to complete either the copy
of the one treatise, or the collation of the other. The delay
became at last so serious that the Committee were obliged to
arrange with Mr. Dziewicki to abandon his retirement in
Russian Poland, and go to Vienna, there to devote his time
from May to October to the Society's work, so far as the
keeping-open of the Library will let him. He will first
copy Loyieae continuatio, then finish the collation of De
Blasplaemm, so as to get these two Treatises (the former with
Loye'ca) to press forthwith‚ and after that, collate De Ente,
probably take over De Potestate Papae from M. Patera, and
finish it, and then copy the rest of Wyclif's works at Vienna
and Prag that are still untranscribed. All Part I. of De
Ente has been copied by Mr. T. Austin and Mr. Bullock.
