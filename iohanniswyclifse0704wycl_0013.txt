INTRODUCTION. IX

There are no regular marks of page or folio, but the folio number
is marked on the first page of each treatise.

On a Hyleaf at the beginning is a table of contents in a hand
contemporary with, or little later than, the book itself:

“In isto libro continentur

(Ρο. 1.) Alex neq (i. e. Alexandri Neckam) super Cantica Canti-
corum.

(140.) Item Sermones Januensis (i. e. Jacobi de Voragine
Archiepiscopi Genuensis) de opere quadragesimali.

(199.) Item distincciones cistrensis utiles valde.

4258.) Item Sermones Magistri Johannis Wiclyf ad simplices
sacerdotes satis catholici.'’

What follows is in another and later hand.

“Tractatus fratris Johannis Bromyard de iure canonico et civili
moraliter applicati secundum ordinem alphabeticum.

Tabula super sex libros Alexandri Necham super Cantica.

Tabula sermonum Wyclyffe.

Tabula distinccionum bromyard.

Tabula contentorum in diversis distinccionibus.

Sermones Magistri Johannis Wyclyffe ad simplices sacerdotes.”

It will be noticed that this later addition differs from the first
table in assigning the distinctions to Bromyard. The tables to the
distinctions still exist, following (fo. 252) immediately after the
distinctions, Originally the volume doubtless contained Wyclif's 40 ser-
mons with an index, but it is now imperfect, ending a very little way
on in the 28⁸¹ sermon. This loss was previous to its being put into
the present binding. As the 40 sermons were alone, the numbering
is confined to this group‚ so that NO 1 here corresponds to N0 23
in the Trinity MS.

Cod. III G 11 of the Prague University Library (ἶ). The Codex III
G 11 (Ι) of Prague University contains, besides the front and back
cover-leaves and five blank leaves of paper not paged, 286 paper-
leaves in 40 paged. There is a table of contents, in a hand of the
XV1¹¹ century, as follows:

Que continentur in isto libro:

Item Pastorale magistri johannis Vx‘ykleff et incipit: Cum duplex debet esse osticium.
Item Conclusiones XXXIII Wykleff et incipiunt: Christus Deus noster caput.
